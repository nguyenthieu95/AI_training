+ GAs with Boltzmann Selection + OX1 + RandomResetting/SwapMutation/ScrambleMutation/InverseMutation
+ python GA.py to run, Graph will show up after complete
-------------
+ EB_GAs.py : Using Entropy Boltzmann, haven't completed
+ GA.ipynb : GA.py using jupyter notebook
+ Two pictures showing that It seems better when we using MultiCross (don't make any change to gens order) than using OX1 (permutation-based)
