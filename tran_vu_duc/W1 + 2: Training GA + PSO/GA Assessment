+ Every configuration with the same energy level E(x) (fitness point) has equal probability of being chosen.
+ Fitter individuals are more likely to be maintained throughout the selection process, while keeping the population diversed.
+ Maintain the balance between "exploration" and "exploitation".

M parents -> M children
M children become the new population (replace their parents)

all models use entropy boltzmann selection scheme, with the population of 300, mutation rate of 0.02 and maximum number of generations of 3000

ASSESSMENT

regarding the crossover method, it seems to me that WAR, or at least the combination of WAR and EBS, is not a very suitable approach for this given problem, as almost all models using it converge fairly early at specific local optimal points, usually at around 0 for ScM/SM/IM models and a little lower for RR model at around -5000.

however, with the usage of MPC method, the results are by far better. every model reach solutions that are extremely close to the global optimum, at around -24000 for ScM/SM/IM models and slightly higher at -20000 for RR model.

in conclusion, among all the acceptable models, i find that EBS-MPC-ScM/SM/IM usually return pretty similar outcomes, both in the convergence time (the number of generations before reaching a solution), and in the optimal points found. meanwhile, an EBS-MPC-RR model does not seem to be able to reach any solution that has fitness point lower than -20000, provided that all models use the same setup (e.g population size, mutation rate, termination condition)

also, if we reduce the initial population size, then the diversity of the population will decrease consequently, resulting in earlier convergence at worse solutions.
