All PSO models have swarm size of 200, maximum number of loops of 1000 and terminate after 100 iterations with no improvement 

ASSESSMENT

For PSO algorithm using star model, positions of all birds in the swarm improve greatly just after a few iterations. However, this model fails to find the global optimum, and prematurely converge at around -22000 instead. Increasing the two constants c1 and c2 can make the model converge faster, but more likely to yield a worse result. 

Compared to the EBS-MPC-RR model last week, PSO-Star network model seems to be slightly better in both convergence time and final outcome.
However, it is inferior to the EBS-MPC-ScM/SM/IM in terms of finding the best solution.

For PSO algorithm using Von Neumann model, it proves to be the most superior so far. The algorithm converges after only 200 iterations, and always returns a result better than -24500, outperforming all of the others in both runtime taken and best solution found.
Takes quite a long time for each loop however.
